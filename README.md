In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. Objective is to analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.

Of the four Capomulin helped treat the tumor with a survival rate of above 80%(Survival.png). Tumor volume decreased gradually over the period of 45 days(Tumor Response.png).

Rest of them had no effect in controlling the tumor, with survial rate dropping to 30% on Infubinol and about 45% on the other two.

Percentage change of the tumor volume on Infubinol, Ketapril and Placebo was a dramatic increase in the range of 46% to 57%, on the other hand Capomulin the change was -19%(Tumor change over 45 days.png).
